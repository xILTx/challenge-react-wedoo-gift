# Wedoogift React Challenge

In this challenge, we need you to create a simple React (web)
application that lets a user select a combination of gift cards.

To help you, a mock server is provided in the `server` folder that
you can start by running `yarn start` (in the `server` folder, 
don't forget to run `yarn install` in the `server` folder too).

See the README.md in the `server` folder to know more about the
API and how it works.

The challenge is composed of 3 levels, each of them is described
in their respective `README.md` file in the `src/levelX` folder.

**You may display the three levels on the same root page of the
React application (App.js).**
